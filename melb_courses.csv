"Bachelor of DesignBachelor DegreeThe Bachelor of Design will teach you to be creative and innovative through studios, site visits, field trips and interactions with industry.",3 years full time / 6 years part time,On campus (Parkville),"February, July Key dates",Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) available Learn more,,,"Good design has the power to transform and provide lasting solutions that improve our lives.
Designers apply creative and open approaches to defining and solving problems, leading to high-quality decisions. This enables businesses and industries to overcome rigid or outdated ways of doing things.
Design has applications in the creation and improvement of our cities, buildings, transport networks, furniture, websites, processes, bridges, landscapes and environment. Designers are innovators who enhance the way we live and interact with the world around us.
Be in demand
With job markets evolving constantly, gaining skills that transfer across industries is really important. The ability to apply design thinking is now recognised as a specific and desirable skill.
As technology drives more and more aspects of our lives, designers are playing an important role expanding the potential of the Internet of Things, such as smart homes, smart cities and intelligent transportation.
If you are imaginative, enjoy learning about new fields, and want to play a role in improving the way we live and the places we live in, Design could be a good fit for you.
Learn through making and doing
Design studios, site visits, field trips and interaction with industry practitioners will take you into ‘real life’ situations with industry briefs.
You will study in award-winning state-of- the-art teaching facilities that demonstrate many of the design techniques you will be working to acquire in class.
The work you will do in class uses the same collaborative approaches you’ll find in workplaces, ensuring you are industry-ready from day one. Many of your teachers are also working in industry at the same time, sharing current knowledge and practice directly with you.
The Bachelor of Design allows you to combine the humanities, sciences and visual and performing arts within a single degree. You can further tailor your skills through breadth study and third-year design specialisations, such as Building Image Modelling (BIM), to expand your core program. You can focus on one or two majors, or complete a major and a specialisation.
Your degree
As a Bachelor of Design student, you’ll use innovative processes to solve problems creatively and determine solutions for a better future. You will develop expert knowledge and skills, and study real projects within the built environment, engineering, technology and performing and visual arts disciplines.

"Bachelor of AgricultureBachelor DegreeStudy at Australia's #1 University and prepare yourself for a professional career in veterinary, agricultural and food sciences",3 years full time / 6 years part time,On campus (Parkville),"March, July Key dates",Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) available Learn more,,,"Agriculture’s focus on science and sustainability is how we will adapt to our changing climate, declining environmental health and increasing demand for safe food production to feed our growing populations.
A Bachelor of Agriculture is your opportunity to use science, technology and business to tackle critical sustainability issues and build a career with lasting impact.
If you’d like to understand how to harness natural processes to sustainably feed our growing population, improve natural resource management and contribute to Australia’s growing agricultural industry, the Bachelor of Agriculture is an ideal choice.
You’ll learn the science necessary to produce safe, high-quality and ethical food and fibre as well as the economics underpinning Australia’s important role in international trade. Australia is a major global supplier of agricultural goods, with $70.1 billion worth of exports forecast in 2024-25 (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry).
An agriculture degree lets you apply biology, chemistry, physics, and economics and see the real-world results of your actions. Whether you start your post-university career in a laboratory, on farms or in a bank, you’ll be making a real impact on the world. You’ll complement your lab and classroom learning with fieldwork, and you can even choose to spend a semester learning at our agricultural research and teaching campus at Dookie, giving you additional hands-on experience and knowledge of farm operations.
Agriculture is at the beginning of a technological revolution, with research by Melbourne academics playing a leading role.Drone-based sensors can monitor plants for disease and water stress across areas equivalent to hundreds of football fields in under an hour. ‘Big data’ and machine learning will give you tools to help farmers grow more food while reducing agriculture’s environmental impact. Study the science and economics underpinning these innovations and enter the workforce ready to contribute to sustainable and profitable agriculture.
Plants and animals provide more food and fibre when we protect their health and welfare. Our academics determine the best ways to maintain the welfare of farm animals, develop diets to help livestock thrive in hot and dry conditions, discover the origin, spread and effects of disease and develop new medicines. Our scientists are using precision gene-editing tools to develop crops that can survive disease, drought and heat. Develop an understanding of plant and animal health and welfare to prepare you for a career in the agricultural industry or for further study in veterinary medicine.
Farmers manage 55 per cent of Australia’s landmass (Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Science). In a changing climate we need to maintain a healthy environment too. Benefit from the knowledge and expertise of our researchers as they find ways to make farming more drought-resilient, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and re-use waste while producing high-quality food. You’ll learn how to monitor and optimise the transfer of nutrients from soils to plants to animals and how to make land and water use more sustainable by applying agricultural science and economics.
Students who complete theDiploma in General Studiespathway program will be eligible for substantial credit towards their Bachelor of Agriculture degree."
