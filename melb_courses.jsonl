Australia is a major global supplier of agricultural goods, with $70.1 billion worth of exports forecast in 2024-25 (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry).\nAn agriculture degree lets you apply biology, chemistry, physics, and economics and see the real-world results of your actions. Whether you start your post-university career in a laboratory, on farms or in a bank, you’ll be making a real impact on the world. You’ll complement your lab and classroom learning with fieldwork, and you can even choose to spend a semester learning at our agricultural research and teaching campus at Dookie, giving you additional hands-on experience and knowledge of farm operations.\nAgriculture is at the beginning of a technological revolution, with research by Melbourne academics playing a leading role.Drone-based sensors can monitor plants for disease and water stress across areas equivalent to hundreds of football fields in under an hour. ‘Big data’ and machine learning will give you tools to help farmers grow more food while reducing agriculture’s environmental impact. Study the science and economics underpinning these innovations and enter the workforce ready to contribute to sustainable and profitable agriculture.\nPlants and animals provide more food and fibre when we protect their health and welfare. Our academics determine the best ways to maintain the welfare of farm animals, develop diets to help livestock thrive in hot and dry conditions, discover the origin, spread and effects of disease and develop new medicines. Our scientists are using precision gene-editing tools to develop crops that can survive disease, drought and heat. Develop an understanding of plant and animal health and welfare to prepare you for a career in the agricultural industry or for further study in veterinary medicine.\nFarmers manage 55 per cent of Australia’s landmass (Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Science). In a changing climate we need to maintain a healthy environment too. Benefit from the knowledge and expertise of our researchers as they find ways to make farming more drought-resilient, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and re-use waste while producing high-quality food. You’ll learn how to monitor and optimise the transfer of nutrients from soils to plants to animals and how to make land and water use more sustainable by applying agricultural science and economics.\nStudents who complete theDiploma in General Studiespathway program will be eligible for substantial credit towards their Bachelor of Agriculture degree.", "Title": "Bachelor of AgricultureBachelor DegreeStudy at Australia's #1 University and prepare yourself for a professional career in veterinary, agricultural and food sciences"}
